# List of the Weirdest Alarm Clock Sounds People Actually Use

## Project Overview

This web application is designed to collect and showcase the most unusual and funny alarm clock sounds that people actually use to wake up in the morning. Users can submit their own alarm sounds, rate others' submissions, and create personalized lists of their favorite (or most jarring) alarm sounds. The app categorizes alarm sounds into types such as "funny," "irritating," "calming," and "weird," enabling users to discover and interact with different sound profiles based on their preferences.
