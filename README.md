# List of the Weirdest Alarm Clock Sounds People Actually Use

## Project Overview

This web application is designed to collect and showcase the most unusual and funny alarm clock sounds that people actually use to wake up in the morning. Users can submit their own alarm sounds, rate others' submissions, and create personalized lists of their favorite (or most jarring) alarm sounds. The app categorizes alarm sounds into types such as "funny," "irritating," "calming," and "weird," enabling users to discover and interact with different sound profiles based on their preferences.

## Why This Project

I chose this project because it’s a fun and interactive way to explore web development concepts while tapping into a topic that people can relate to. The concept of alarm sounds adds humor and uniqueness to the project, and it's highly customizable based on user interaction. This project will help me develop key full-stack development skills, such as handling dynamic user input, categorizing data, and building a personalized user experience. Additionally, it presents a creative challenge in implementing sound files and managing ratings in a database. I’m excited to combine something silly with a technical challenge, creating an app that can bring a smile to people's faces while pushing my skills as a developer.
